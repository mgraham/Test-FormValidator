Revision history for Test-FormValidator

0.06    November 16, 2005
        - $tfv->check_ok now returns a $results object on failure as
          well as on success
        - added $tfv->results (useful for examining the results after
          calling $tfv->check_not_ok)
        - minor doc fix

0.05    October 20, 2005
        - fix so that $tfv->check() works with a CGI query object
        - added check_ok() and check_not_ok() (suggested by Mark Stosberg)

0.04    October 11, 2005
        - fixed bug with invalid_ok where the presense of extra fields
          in %fields_and_constraints spec wasn't considered a test
          failure

0.03    October 11, 2005
        - added 'prefix()'
        - changed 'comment' to 'description' throughout (Test::Simple
          calls it 'name', but the TAP doc calls it 'description'.
          Either way, 'comment' is wrong)
